		<h1 id="History">Going Down the memory Lane...</h1>
        <p>S.Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia which originally was started in Mutwal in the year 1851, started as a Boarding school. The shift to a permanent house system was only to take place with the move to Mount Lavinia in 1918. The houses were named Claughton, Chapman, Read, Copleston and Miller. There was also a small, rather short-lived Winchester House (although the present Primary School boarding facility is still known by this name). At the time, Miller and Copleston were senior houses. In 1932, the boarding house system of two senior houses and two junior houses was discarded in favour of an alternative system.
